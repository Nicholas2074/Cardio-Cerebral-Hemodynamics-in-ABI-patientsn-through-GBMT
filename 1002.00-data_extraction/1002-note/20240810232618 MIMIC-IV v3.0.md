### MIMIC-IV v3.0

MIMIC-IV v3.0 was released in July 19, 2024. Stays occurring between 2020 and 2022, inclusive, were added to the database. Out of hospital mortality is available for up to 1-year post hospital or ED discharge. The number of additional patients, admissions, and stays are highlighted by the increased row counts of their respective tables:

- *patients*: 364,627 (was 299,712 in v2.2)
- *admissions*: 546,028 (was 431,231 in v2.2)
- *icustays*: 94,458 (was 73,181 in v2.2)

Other changes include:

- Improved language data. The language column of *admissions* now provides a standardized primary language, if non-English, rather than "?" as before.
- Improved insurance data. The categories of the insurance column of *admissions* have been expanded to "Medicare", "Medicaid", "Private", "Self-pay", "No charge", and "Other". This change better aligns the field with other databases such as the National Inpatient Sample.
