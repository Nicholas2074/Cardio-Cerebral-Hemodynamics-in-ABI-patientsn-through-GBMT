# Cardio-Cerebral-Hemodynamics-in-ABI-patientsn-through-GBMT
Objective: This study aimed to describe longitudinal changes of cardio-cerebral hemodynamics in acute brain injury (ABI) patients.
Methods: ABI patients with intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and rate pressure product (RPP) records were identified from the Medical Information Mart for the Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 3.0, eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) 2.0. Group-based multivariate trajectory (GBMT) modeling was employed to identify clusters of patients with common trends of hemodynamics within 4-hour intervals over a period of 120 hours post-ICU admission. Multivariable logistics regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between the GBMT clusters and in-hospital mortality in ABI patients. The feature importance of the clusters was determined using machine learning algorithms and subgroup analysis based on different subgroups was also performed.
